				<p>jiraiya has incredible chakra levels. So much so that he could summon Gamabunta while his chakra and stamina were drained from being drugged. Note that at the time, Naruto needed a portion of Kurama’s power to pull that off.

				<p>Even though Itachi did say that a fight against Jiraiya would lead to both of them killing each other, the statement was merely for the purpose of avoiding conflict where he could since his intentions were always good. In truth, Itachi's Mangekyo Sharingan abilities of the Amaterasu, Tsukuyomi, and the Susano'o on top of that were enough to deal with Jiraiya.

				<p>People always underestimate this dude just because he’s weak in terms of physical prowess and ninjutsu - he’s cool, he’s smart and collected - but he’s rarely called badass and I think people forget he can truly be badass if he wants too. But he’s an all around pretty chill guy that we forget he can be ruthless.</p>
